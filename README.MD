In multithreaded C#, it can be wasteful to use one single lock for all threads. Some examples:

- When creating a lot of directories, you can create one lock for threads that create directories, or you could create a lock object per "highest level" directory
- When processing a lot of bank transactions, you can process transactions in parallel, except when they come from the same person. In that case you probably want to run those
  transactions sequentially. In that case, you would create a keyed semaphore where the key is the ID of that person.
- etc.

This library helps you create a lock object per key, and then use that lock object to improve the parallelism in your application.

# Summary

Old version: no transactions run in parallel, because they might come from the same person, in which case the transactions must be processed sequentially

```csharp
public class BankTransactionProcessor 
{
  private readonly object _lock = new object();
  
  public async Task Process(BankTransaction transaction) 
  {
    lock(_lock) 
    {
       ...
    }
  }
}
``` 

New version: all transactions can run in parallel, except the ones with the same person ID

```csharp
public class BankTransactionProcessor
{
  public async Task Process(BankTransaction transaction) 
  {
    var key = transaction.Person.Id.ToString();
    using (await KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync(key))
    {
      ...
    }
  }
}
``` 

# Usage

The static method `KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync(string key)` covers most use cases, this sample snippet shows how it works:

```csharp
var tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 4)
    .Select(async i =>
    {
        var key = "Key" + Math.Ceiling((double)i / 2);
        Log($"Task {i:0}: I am waiting for key '{key}'");
        using (await KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync(key))
        {
            Log($"Task {i:0}: Hello world! I have key '{key}' now!");
            await Task.Delay(50);
        }

        Log($"Task {i:0}: I have released '{key}'");
    });
await Task.WhenAll(tasks.AsParallel());

void Log(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now:HH:mm:ss.fff} #{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId:000} {message}");
}

Internally, `KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync(string key)` uses a static singleton instance of `KeyedSemaphoresCollection<string>`. 
If you want to have multiple collections, or want to use something other than `string` as `TKey`, you can instantiate your own `KeyedSemaphoresCollection<TKey>` like this:

```csharp
var collection1 = new KeyedSemaphoresCollection<int>();
var collection2 = new KeyedSemaphoresCollection<int>();
var collection1Tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 4)
    .Select(async i =>
    {
        var key = (int) Math.Ceiling((double)i / 2);
        Log($"Collection 1 - Task {i:0}: I am waiting for key '{key}'");
        using (await collection1.LockAsync(key))
        {
            Log($"Collection 1 - Task {i:0}: Hello world! I have key '{key}' now!");
            await Task.Delay(50);
        }
        Log($"Collection 1 - Task {i:0}: I have released '{key}'");
    });
var collection2Tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 4)
    .Select(async i =>
    {
        var key = (int) Math.Ceiling((double)i / 2);
        Log($"Collection 2 - Task {i:0}: I am waiting for key '{key}'");
        using (await collection2.LockAsync(key))
        {
            Log($"Collection 2 - Task {i:0}: Hello world! I have key '{key}' now!");
            await Task.Delay(50);
        }

        Log($"Collection 2 - Task {i:0}: I have released '{key}'");
    });
await Task.WhenAll(collection1Tasks.Concat(collection2Tasks).AsParallel());

void Log(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now:HH:mm:ss.fff} #{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId:000} {message}");
}

# Controlling the number of semaphores

The `KeyedSemaphoresCollection` constructor takes a single parameter called `numberOfSemaphores`
Internally, every key maps to one semaphore. This means that, if your number of unique keys if higher than the number of semaphores, it is possible that
two different keys share the same semaphore and therefore do not run concurrently.
If you know the number of unique keys beforehand, you can initialize the collection like this:

```csharp
int numberOfUniqueKeys = 25000;
var collection = new KeyedSemaphoresCollection<int>(numberOfUniqueKeys);
```

# Timeout and cancellation

Keyed semaphores supports parameters for both timeout and cancellation handling, similar to the SemaphoreSlim API.

## Cancellation only

The following methods support cancellation and will throw an `OperationCanceledException` if necessary.

```csharp
class KeyedSemaphoresCollection<TKey> 
{
  IDisposable Lock(TKey key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
  Task<IDisposable> LockAsync(TKey key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
CancellationToken cancellationToken = ...;
using(await KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync("123", cancellationToken)) 
{
  // Your code here
}
```

## Nested locking

There is a considerable footgun present in this library, and it is triggered with nested locking.
In a nutshell, watch out with this kind of code anywhere in your project:

```csharp
using(await KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync("123", cancellationToken)) 
{
  using(await KeyedSemaphore.LockAsync("456", cancellationToken)) 
  {
    // Your code here
  }
}
```

It doesn't even have to be inside the same method, anywhere along the call stack is problematic.
The problem that can occur is deadlocking. This happens when the keys you provide all map to the same underlying `SemaphoreSlim`, in which case a deadlock can occur within one thread or between multiple threads.
The default static keyed semaphore collection size is 4096, so mathematically the odds of a deadlock occurring with nested locking is 1 in 4096, assuming .NET's hashing algorithm is uniformly distributed.
Also note that the hashing seed changes if you restart your application, so if you are running into this deadlock issue, restarting the application will probably temporarily bypass the issue, but it will only be a matter of time until you run into it again.

Fortunately, there is a rather easy, structural solution: use separate collections if you need nested locking. This avoids the issue entirely.

```csharp
var topLevelCollection = new KeyedSemaphoresCollection<string>();
var nestedCollection = new KeyedSemaphoresCollection<string>();
using(await topLevelCollection.LockAsync("123", cancellationToken)) 
{
  using(await nestedCollection.LockAsync("456", cancellationToken)) 
  {
    // Your code here
  }
}
```

You can also avoid nested locking if possible. It's typically not a best practice to have long lived locks.

## Timeout + cancellation

The following methods support timeout _and_ cancellation. 
Note that these methods return a boolean. Your lock-constrained code must be provided  through the _callback_ parameter.

```csharp
class KeyedSemaphoresCollection<TKey> 
{
  bool TryLock(TKey key, TimeSpan timeout, Action callback, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
  Task<bool> TryLockAsync(TKey key, TimeSpan timeout, Action callback, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
  Task<bool> TryLockAsync(TKey key, TimeSpan timeout, Func<Task> callback, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
CancellationToken cancellationToken = ...;
if(await KeyedSemaphore.TryLockAsync("123", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), CallbackAsync, cancellationToken)) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Lock was acquired within 10 seconds!");
}

async Task CallbackAsync() 
{
  // Your code here
}
```

# Alternatives

KeyedSemaphores is not the only game in town, I am aware of 
- [AsyncKeyedLock](https://github.com/MarkCiliaVincenti/AsyncKeyedLock)
- [StripedAsyncLock](https://github.com/i3arnon/AsyncUtilities)

If you're interested in how they compare performance-wise, I have some benchmarks here: https://github.com/amoerie/keyed-semaphores/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.MD

Don't just take these numbers at face value though.
You should be aware that every library makes different tradeoffs, and that benchmarks probably don't represent your exact use case.
Try before you buy!
